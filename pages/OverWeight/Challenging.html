        <h2>Excercise Regimen</h2>
        <div class="exer">
            <h4>Cardio</h4>
            Frequency: 3-4 times per week <br>
            Duration: 20-30 minutes per session <br>
            Activities:<br>
            High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): Perform short bursts of intense exercises such as sprinting,
            jumping jacks, or burpees followed by brief rest periods. Aim for 20-30 seconds of high-intensity effort
            followed by 10-20 seconds of rest. Repeat for the duration of the session. HIIT is highly effective for
            burning calories and improving cardiovascular fitness in a shorter amount of time compared to steady-state
            cardio. <br>
            Cycling: Incorporate cycling sessions, either outdoors or on a stationary bike, alternating between
            high-intensity intervals and moderate recovery periods. Cycling helps to engage large muscle groups,
            boosting calorie burn and enhancing cardiovascular endurance. <br>
            Jump Rope: Incorporate jump rope exercises into your routine, alternating between different jumping styles
            such as single-leg hops, double unders, and high knees. Jump rope workouts are effective for burning
            calories, improving coordination, and increasing overall agility.
            <br>
            <h4>Strength Training</h4>
            Frequency: 4-5 times per week <br>
            Activities:<br>
            Compound Movements: Focus on compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups simultaneously, such as
            deadlifts, squats, bench presses, and rows. Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions for each exercise,
            progressively increasing the weight or resistance over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.
            <br>
            Circuit Training: Incorporate circuit-style workouts that combine strength exercises with brief periods of
            cardio or active recovery. Perform a series of strength exercises back-to-back with minimal rest in between,
            targeting different muscle groups in each circuit. This approach keeps your heart rate elevated, maximizing
            calorie burn and promoting muscle endurance. <br>
            Plyometric Exercises: Integrate plyometric exercises such as box jumps, squat jumps, and medicine ball slams
            into your routine to enhance explosive power, agility, and calorie expenditure. Plyometrics involve rapid
            stretching and contracting of muscles, making them an effective way to torch calories while improving
            athletic performance.

            <h4>Flexibility and Mobility</h4>
            Frequency: 1-2 times per week <br>
            Activities: <br>
            Yoga or Pilates: Include regular sessions of yoga or Pilates to improve flexibility, mobility, and overall
            body awareness. Focus on poses and movements that target tight or stiff areas, such as hip openers,
            hamstring stretches, and spinal twists. Yoga and Pilates also promote relaxation and stress reduction, which
            are important for overall well-being during weight loss journeys. <br>
            Foam Rolling: Incorporate foam rolling sessions into your routine to release tension in muscles and improve
            tissue quality. Spend time rolling over different muscle groups, focusing on areas of tightness or
            discomfort. Foam rolling helps to enhance recovery, reduce muscle soreness, and optimize performance during
            workouts.
