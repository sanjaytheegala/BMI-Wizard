        <h2>Excercise Regimen</h2>
        <div class="exer">
            <h4>Cardiovascular Exercise:</h4>
            Brisk Walking: Start with 10-15 minutes of brisk walking, gradually increasing to 30-45 minutes as endurance
            improves. Aim for a pace that elevates your heart rate and makes you slightly breathless but still able to
            carry on a conversation. <br>
            Water Aerobics: Consider joining a water aerobics class at your local pool. Water provides resistance while
            being gentle on the joints, making it an excellent option for those with obesity.

            <h4>Strength Training</h4>
            Activities:<br>
            Bodyweight Exercises: Perform bodyweight exercises targeting major muscle groups. Start with 2-3 sets of
            8-12 repetitions for each exercise, gradually increasing intensity and repetitions as you build strength. <br>
            Include exercises such as: <br>
            Squats: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips
            back, then return to the starting position. <br>
            Wall Push-Ups: Stand facing a wall, place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, and perform push-ups by
            bending your elbows and lowering your chest towards the wall. <br>
            Seated Leg Lifts: Sit on a chair with your back straight, lift one leg straight out in front of you, hold
            for a few seconds, then lower it back down. Alternate legs. <br>
            Resistance Bands: Incorporate resistance bands for added resistance and variety in your strength training
            routine. Perform exercises such as bicep curls, lateral raises, and seated rows.
            <h4>Flexibility and Mobility: </h4>
            Stretching: Dedicate time to stretching exercises to improve flexibility and mobility. Hold each stretch for
            15-30 seconds and repeat 2-3 times. Focus on stretching major muscle groups such as the quadriceps,
            hamstrings, calves, chest, back, and shoulders. <br>
            Yoga or Tai Chi: Consider joining a beginner-level yoga or Tai Chi class to improve flexibility, balance,
            and relaxation. These practices also promote mindfulness and body awareness.
