                </h3>
                <p>Option 1: Prepare a nutritious vegetable oats upma by sautéing mixed vegetables like carrots, peas,
                    and capsicum with rolled oats and spices. Oats are high in fiber, which aids in digestion and keeps

                    Option 2: Indulge in boiled egg whites seasoned with a dash of black pepper. Eggs are an excellent

                    <br> <br>
                    Option 2: Munch on crunchy cucumber and carrot sticks paired with creamy hummus. Hummus is a
                    nutritious dip made from chickpeas, tahini, and olive oil, providing a good source of protein and

                    tomatoes, and a tangy blend of spices. Sprouts are low in calories but high in nutrients, making

                    Option 2: Savor the crunch of roasted chickpeas (chana) seasoned with chaat masala. Roasted chickpeas
                    are a nutritious and satisfying snack that can help curb cravings and keep hunger at bay.

                    serving of steamed broccoli and a small portion of quinoa. Fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,
                    which support heart health and promote weight loss.
                    <br> <br>
                    Option 2: Indulge in paneer (cottage cheese) tikka skewers marinated in a flavorful blend of spices
                    and served with a refreshing cucumber and tomato salad. Paneer is a good source of protein and
